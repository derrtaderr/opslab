# AI Ops Lab: Product Requirements Document (Updated with Miro REST API Details)

## 1. Product Overview

**Product Name**  
**AI Ops Lab** – A web-based, collaborative platform for operations managers and their teams to discover high-impact AI opportunities, estimate ROI, and outline an implementation plan. This tool seamlessly **embeds** your existing Miro board (containing the AI cards and associated features) via the **Miro REST API**.

**Product Vision**  
- Provide a structured "AI Design Sprint" in a self-service model.  
- Let users map processes, identify bottlenecks, calculate ROI for AI solutions, and export a final summary.  
- Use the **Miro REST API** to embed your existing Miro board for real-time, multi-user collaboration and to programmatically add or edit board elements (e.g., sticky notes for user-submitted pain points).

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas

### 2.1 Primary Persona: Operations Manager in Mid-Market Tech

- **Role**: Director/VP of Sales Ops, Revenue Ops, or Business Ops  
- **Demographics**: 35–50 years old, bachelor's/MBA, leading a team in a tech firm (100–1,000 employees)  
- **Goals**: Identify AI automation opportunities, prove ROI, and scale without adding headcount.

### 2.2 Secondary Persona: Team Collaborators
